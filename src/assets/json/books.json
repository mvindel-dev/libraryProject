    "title": "Romeo and Juliet",
    "author": "William Shakespeare",
    "description": "The story of Romeo and Juliet has antecedents in Greek mythology and literature and in some medieval legends. During the 15th and 16th centuries it was the subject of multiple versions, but it was Shakespeare who infused it with a passion and drama never seen before and that have contributed to maintaining the legend in the collective memory. In Verona, two young lovers, from two enemy families, are victims of a situation of hatred and violence that they neither desire nor can remedy. On one of those summer afternoons when the heat 'inflames the blood', Romeo, newly married in secret to his beloved Juliet, kills her cousin. From there Shakespeare unleashes tragedy and precipitates events, guided by chance and fate.",
